    "prompt": "all right, we got interrupted. read context.json and prompt-history.json to understand what we were doing before. you don't have to do the prompt-history stuff again, it's just for your understanding. now what i want you to do is this:  awesome. now there's one more thing i'd like to add. i've opted to use low-level dialects, and i won't use jupyternotebooks on the website anymore. instead, i'm going to write my own code-editor that uses code-mirror. and the programming languages used won't be the standard programming languages, but low-level dialects of popular programming languages that will be a part of this project. so essentially, this project will be self-contained instead of relying on jupyter notebooks. the compiler for these dialects will also run completely in the browser, and will be a part of this project, but the compiler will be written in C and will be an entirely separate repo that this will install. for now, you can stub out the compiler. but essentially, it'll take the code that the user has submitted, and generate output that shows up in the code editor. My low-level dialects will be llPython, llJavascript, llTypescript, llDart, llKotlin, llSwift, llJava, llC#, and llGo. You can add a section in the nav that has an overview of these. for the tracks, i also want you to group tracks not only by industry but also by the user's language of choice. so somethin like, \"For Python Devs\", \"For Javascript Devs\", and so on. and so forth. I'll leave the design to your discretion. I don't like the glassmorphism design you did with the dark/light mode toggle and the \"Home\" button that has the site name, so fix that to use a standard shadcn-like toggle. in fact, you can use shadcn as your UI basis and then only modify certain pages to have the glassmorphism background. make sure to update context. update the listin of ADTs to organize them, not alphabetically, but by a more logical division first, and then maybe degrees of difficulty. We have Linear ADTs, of which there's index based, then node based. Then we also have non-linear ADTs, and in these we hav various trees and graphs. so do that an"
